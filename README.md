## Gtasks-Ha a Google Tasks Custom Component for Home Assistant
Forked from original repo by [@BlueBlueBlob](https://github.com/blueblueblob)

You will probably also want to install the lovelace card to make best use of this. [lovelace-gtasks-card](https://github.com/myntath/lovelace-gtasks-card)

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `gtasks`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/gtasks/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. Choose:
   - Add `gtasks:` to your HA configuration.
   - In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Google Tasks"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/gtasks/.translations/en.json
custom_components/gtasks/__init__.py
custom_components/gtasks/binary_sensor.py
custom_components/gtasks/config_flow.py
custom_components/gtasks/const.py
custom_components/gtasks/manifest.json
custom_components/gtasks/sensor.py
custom_components/gtasks/switch.py
```

## Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
gtasks:
  credentials_location: /path/credentials.json
  default_list: 'My task list'
  force_login: false
```
